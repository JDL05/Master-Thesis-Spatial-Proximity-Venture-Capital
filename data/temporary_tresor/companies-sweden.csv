This gives the consumer an incentive to recycle the package. Our world-unique position-based scanning technology enables consumers to receive a deposit value in their mobile phone when recycling their packaging at pinpointed places. Our solution can be connected to all sorts of packaging – everything from plastic bags to take-away mugs to products. There is no longer any need to invest in expensive reverse vending machines – instead, consumers are able to recycle at already existing recycling stations or at othe pinpointed locations selected by connected consumer brands. centivizing recycling with financial means is a proven way to increase recycling rates. Bower® is a mobile app that enables consumer brands to put a deposit value on their packaging – either in the form of money or points. By doing so, they take a greater responsibility for their packaging and, at the same time, get a direct relationship to their end-consumers through the app. To create a deposit system is simpler than it sounds.

Release the Power. Digitalization quickly accelerates energy consumption. In 2030, the ICT (Information and Communications Technology) sector is projected to stand for more than one-fifth of the global electricity demand. Maximizing performance per watt in servers and smart devices is critical to breaking the trend. ZeroPoint technology delivers up to 50% more performance per watt by removing unnecessary information from microchips in data centers (CPU) and smart devices (SoC), meaning that:  •	Data centers can maximize performance and reduce energy consumption.  •	Smart device developers can maximize performance and user experience without compromising on battery life. Typical memory contains up to 70% unnecessary information. ZeroPoint technology removes all this information by combining ultra-fast data compression with realtime data compaction and transparent memory management. Integrating these three areas into one solution for maximizing performance per watt makes us unique.  ZeroPoint is the result of decades of frontline research and in-depth technical knowledge. We have a strong patent portfolio and a pipeline of ideas related to our core business. ZeroPoint delivers a hardware IP block that customers integrate on their SoC. We work closely with industry-leading companies in product implementation projects targeting the most advanced technology nodes available. The Technology, ideas and many of the people behind and with ZeroPoint comes from Professor Per Stenström’s research group, which is internationally recognized for excellence within high-performance computing.

This is commonly used for proactive maintenance, operational optimization, and to make your products more intuitive. The uniqueness, and the result of 7 years of machine learning research at the University of Borås in Sweden, is the ability to do this at the edge of the network, on the actual device. The benefits are significant. You can process all the data in real-time. More sensors equals more data, and the only way to manage this flood is through a layered approach that starts by the data source. You can take instant actions. You learn and act based on the normal condition of the individual device. You radically reduce network load by not sending raw data, but rather sending relevant and curated data to the cloud for further analysis. Your connected things become autonomously smart and less dependent on the quality of the network connection.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Science and Engineering, Software",3,11-50,"Anders Alneng, Jon Lindén, Rikard König",6,,2022-12-19,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,5999482,USD,5999482,8477324,USD,8477324,"European Innovation Council, Almi Invest, VentureOut, Etteplan, Walerud Ventures",5,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2

The concept of BYON8 and the company vision was already established several years before concretization in 2015. All ideas need financial backup and it all started with Josefs and Matias idea regarding a medical A.I (AITOPYA) being pitched at Liu Innovations offices at Mjardevi Center. Liu Innovation and the university has been a steady supporter ever since and Liu Holdings have joined in. Because of its short history BYON8 is understandably still in its start-up phase but it is now actively seeking further financial support through venture capitalists and viable partners.

Our platform consists of three key components that work in harmony to provide an unparalleled development experience: 1. Triform Core: Our API-based infrastructure platform that serves as the engine powering the entire ecosystem. Core provides:     - Infrastructure for isolated execution of code written by users or AI     - Flow orchestration for executing multiple code components as a cohesive solution     - Comprehensive access management     - Detailed statistics, monitoring, and logging capabilities          Users can publish Actions (executable code) as Components and connect them with Flows, enabling a truly composable architecture. These flows are then exposed as APIs, ready to be consumed by any application. Critically, all Flows and Actions run completely serverless, consuming resources only when actually used, which dramatically lowers the barrier to entry and reduces operational costs.      2. Triform Builder: A sophisticated multi-agent solution that automates the creation and management of backend systems, specifically tailored for agentic solutions. Builder isn't just another autocomplete tool – it's a full-fledged development partner that can:     - Take natural language requirements and generate entire solutions in minutes     - Leverage a team of nine specialized AI agents working in concert     - Handle everything from code generation to testing and deployment     - Dramatically reduce development time through automation 3. Triform Canvas: The human interface to Core and Builder, providing a visual environment where users can create, manage, test, and monitor their AI workflows. Through Canvas, users can:     - Visually create and manage Flows and Actions through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface     - Define tests to validate functionality during both development and production     - Execute tests on any component, gaining insights into performance and areas for improvement     - Deploy software into production with a single click     - Monitor solutions through a graphically rich interface showing both qualitative and quantitative performance metrics Our architecture scales seamlessly and can be deployed both in the cloud for hyperscaling and on-premise for secure, air-gapped environments.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Hardware, Internet Services, Science and Engineering",4,1-10,"Christoffer Wikström, Iggy Gullstrand, Josef Nilsen, Zackarias Ulvskog",1,Seed,2024-10-01,50000,EUR,55322,Pre-Seed,50000,EUR,55322,Pre-Seed,50000,EUR,55322,50000,EUR,55322,Antler,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,1
